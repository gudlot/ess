ess - Data reduction for ESS instrumentation
============================================

`European Spallation Source`_ (ESS) toolkit for neutron scattering data reduction powered by `scipp`_ and `scippneutron`_.
Provides ESS facility and instrument bespoke tools.
The ``ess`` module is part of the software stack for data reduction:

- ``scipp``, ``scippneutron``, and ``ess`` are Python packages that can be installed using ``conda``.
  Each package is released independently.
- ``ess-notebooks`` is a ``git`` repository containing Jupyter notebooks with exampels and actual reduction workflows.
- Higher levels of the stack are optional, and it is absolutely possible to use ``scippneutron`` without ``ess``, or ``ess`` without ``ess-notebooks``.

New features may frequently be introduced on the top of the software stack, for example in ``ess-notebooks``.
Depending on the feature this may then gradually move to lower levels.
This involves a "filtering" process, since scope and contribution guidelines are different the lower the level in the stack.
